      <ul>
        <p><strong>2014</strong></p>
        <li>
          <strong>The Gamma matrix operator to summarize dense and sparse data sets in array database system</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed and implemented a parallel operator for data summarization in array database (SciDB) using C++;</li>
            <li>Applied the operator to accelerate the process of linear regression and PCA in R;</li>
            <li>Eliminated the RAM limitations of R with the help of the integration of our array operator.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statistical and graph analysis integrating R and column-based database system</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Unified the data exchange interface between R and column-based database systems (SciDB and Vertica);</li>
            <li>Overloaded basic matrix operators in R to translate matrix operations to SQL queries;</li>
            <li>Achieved equal or even faster analysis speed compared with the R package even when data fit in RAM.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Horizontal and vertical percentage aggregation in column-based DBMS</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Proposed and implemented the SQL queries for percentage aggregations on CUBE;</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented the aggregation query generator (Java and JDBC);</li>
            <li>Saved up to 20% computation time compared with traditional OLAP approach.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coin recognition using digital image processing approach</strong> (course project)
          <ul>
            <li>Aimed to distinguish coins from the background and count the total denomination;</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented a ring projection approach to eliminate to affect of coin rotation;</li>
            <li>Trained the neuron network to identify the coin features.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
